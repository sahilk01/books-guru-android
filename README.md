Books Guru is an Android application that analyzes books and visualizes character relationships through interactive network graphs.

## ✨ Features

- **Book Analysis**: Analyze books to identify key characters and their interactions
- **Character Exploration**: View detailed information about each character, including number of mentions
- **Relationship Visualization**: Explore character relationships through an interactive network graph
- **Native Rendering**: Optimized native graph visualizations with smooth animations and interactions
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful Material 3 design with animations and transitions

## 📱 Installation

## 🚀 Core Functionalities

### Book Search
Enter a book ID to analyze its characters and relationships. The app fetches character data and generates a comprehensive analysis.

### Character Analysis
Explore detailed information about each character, including:
- Number of mentions
- Character descriptions
- Relationship with other characters

### Interactive Network Visualization
The app's most powerful feature is its interactive character relationship graph:
- Drag characters to reposition them
- Pinch to zoom in/out
- Tap on characters to view details
- Physics-based animations for natural interactions

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

Books Guru is built using modern Android development practices:

- **Kotlin**: 100% Kotlin codebase
- **Jetpack Compose**: Declarative UI toolkit for modern Android UI
- **Material 3**: Latest Material Design guidelines
- **MVVM Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Coroutines & Flow**: For asynchronous operations and reactive data streams
- **Hilt**: For dependency injection
- **Retrofit**: For API communication
- **Force-Directed Graph**: Custom physics implementation for character networks

## 🧪 How It Works

1. The app sends a request to our API with the book ID
2. The API analyzes the book and identifies characters and their relationships
3. The app processes this data and constructs an interactive network graph
4. Users can explore characters and their connections through an intuitive touch interface

## 🔧 Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:sahilk01/books-guru-android.git
   ```
   
2. Open the project in Android Studio
